# issuer-ocsp-responses contains two OCSP responses from test-ca.pem, signed by
# test-ca.pem. One is signed 2014, good til 2015, and the other is signed 2015,
# good til 2030. Only the latter should be served. Note that order is important.
# If there are two entries for the same serial number in the file, the one that
# occurs last in the file will take priority.
#
# The response were generated with:
# openssl x509 -outform der -in test/test-root.pem  -out test/test-root.der
# single-ocsp --issuer test/test-root.der --responder test/test-root.der \
#   --target test/test-ca.der --template template.json  --pkcs11 ~/pkcs11.json \
#   --out ocsp.rsp
# base64 ocsp.rsp | tr -d '\n' > issuer-ocsp-responses.txt
# Note that you must setup SoftHSM locally, import the private key from
# test-ca.key, and put appropriate settings in pkcs11.json for this to work.
# Format is one base64-encoded DER entry per line.
#
# template.json looks like this:
# {
#   "Status": 0,
#   "ThisUpdate": "2014-09-23T00:00:00Z",
#   "NextUpdate": "2015-08-23T00:00:00Z"
# }
