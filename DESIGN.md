# Boulder flow diagrams

Boulder is built in a rather decentralized way in order to enable different
parts to be deployed in different security contexts.

In order for you to understand how boulder works and ensure it's working correctly,
this document lays out how various operations flow through boulder.  We show a
diagram of how calls go between components, and provide notes on what each
component does to help the process along.  Each step is in its own subsection
below, in roughly the order that they happen in certificate issuance.

A couple of notes:

* For simplicity, we do not show interactions with the Storage Authority.
  The SA simply acts as a common data store for the various components.  It
  is written to by the RA (registrations and authorizations) and the CA
  (certificates), and read by WFE, RA, and CA.

* The interactions shown in the diagrams are the calls that go between
  components.  These calls are done via the AMQP-based RPC code in `./rpc/`.

* In various places the Boulder implementation of ACME diverges from the current
  RFC draft. These divergences are documented in [docs/acme-divergences.md](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/master/docs/acme-divergences.md).


## New Registration

```
1: Client ---new-reg--> WFE
2:                      WFE ---NewRegistration--> RA
3:                      WFE <-------return------- RA
4: Client <------------ WFE
```

Notes:

* 1-2: WFE does the following:
  * Verify that the request is a POST
  * Verify the JWS signature on the POST body
  * Parse the registration object
  * Filters illegal fields from the registration object

* 2-3: RA does the following:
  * Verify that the registered account key is acceptable
  * Create a new registration and add the client's information
  * Store the registration (which gives it an ID)
  * Return the registration as stored

* 3-4: WFE does the following:
  * Return the registration, with a unique URL


## Updated Registration

```
1: Client ---reg--> WFE
2:                  WFE ---UpdateRegistration--> RA
