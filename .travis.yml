# Only build pushes to the master branch, PRs, and branches beginning with
# `test-`. You should not push branches beginning with `test-` to the
# letsencrypt repository, but this is a convenient way to push branches to your
# own fork of the repostiroy to ensure Travis passes before submitting a PR.
# For instance, you might run:
# git push myremote branchname:test-branchname
branches:
  only:
    - master
    - staging
    - release
    - /^test-.*$/

# By providing our own install command we avoid Travis' default Go install
# command, which runs `go get`. We specifically want to avoid that because we
# want to ensure all our dependencies are vendored.
