# `ceremony`

```
ceremony --config path/to/config.yml
```

`ceremony` is a tool designed for Certificate Authority specific key and certificate ceremonies. The main design principle is that unlike most ceremony tooling there is a single user input, a configuration file, which is required to complete a root, intermediate, or key ceremony. The goal is to make ceremonies as simple as possible and allow for simple verification of a single file, instead of verification of a large number of independent commands.

`ceremony` operates in one of three modes
* `root` - generates a signing key on HSM and creates a self-signed root certificate that uses the generated key, outputting a PEM public key, and a PEM certificate
* `intermediate` - creates a intermediate certificate and signs it using a signing key already on a HSM, outputting a PEM certificate
* `key` - generates a signing key on HSM, outputting a PEM public key

These modes are set in the `ceremony-type` field of the configuration file.

## Configuration format

`ceremony` uses YAML for its configuration file, mainly as it allows for commenting. Each ceremony type has a different set of configuration fields.

### Root ceremony

- `ceremony-type`: string describing the ceremony type, `root`.
- `pkcs11`: object containing PKCS#11 related fields.
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `module` | Path to the PKCS#11 module to use to communicate with a HSM. |
    | `pin` | Specifies the login PIN, should only be provided if the HSM device requires one to interact with the slot. |
    | `store-key-in-slot` | Specifies which HSM object slot the generated signing key should be stored in. |
    | `store-key-with-label` | Specifies the HSM object label for the generated signing key. |
- `key`: object containing key generation related fields.
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `type` | Specifies the type of key to be generated, either `rsa` or `ecdsa`. If `rsa` the generated key will have an exponent of 65537 and a modulus length specified by `rsa-mod-length`. If `ecdsa` the curve is specified by `ecdsa-curve`. |
    | `ecdsa-curve` | Specifies the ECDSA curve to use when generating key, either `P-224`, `P-256`, `P-384`, or `P-521`. |
    | `rsa-mod-length` | Specifies the length of the RSA modulus, either `2048` or `4096`.
- `outputs`: object containing paths to write outputs.
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `public-key-path` | Path to store generated PEM public key. |
    | `certificate-path` | Path to store signed PEM certificate. |
- `certificate-profile`: object containing profile for certificate to generate. Fields are documented [below](#Certificate-profile-format).

Example:

```yaml
ceremony-type: root
pkcs11:
    module: /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
    store-key-in-slot: 0
    store-key-with-label: root signing key
key:
    type: ecdsa
    ecdsa-curve: P-384
outputs:
    public-key-path: /home/user/root-signing-pub.pem
    certificate-path: /home/user/root-cert.pem
certificate-profile:
    signature-algorithm: ECDSAWithSHA384
    common-name: CA intermediate
    organization: good guys
    country: US
    not-before: 2020-01-01 12:00:00
    not-after: 2040-01-01 12:00:00
    key-usages:
        - Cert Sign
        - CRL Sign
```

This config generates a ECDSA P-384 key in the HSM with the object label `root signing key` and uses this key to sign a self-signed certificate. The public key for the key generated is written to `/home/user/root-signing-pub.pem` and the certificate is written to `/home/user/root-cert.pem`.

### Intermediate ceremony

- `ceremony-type`: string describing the ceremony type, `intermediate`.

Example:

```yaml

    signing-key-id: ffff
inputs:
    public-key-path: /home/user/intermediate-signing-pub.pem
    issuer-path: /home/user/root-cert.pem

certificate-profile:
    signature-algorithm: ECDSAWithSHA384
    common-name: CA root
    organization: good guys
    country: US
    not-before: 2020-01-01 12:00:00

This config generates an intermediate certificate signed by a key in the HSM, identified by the object label `root signing key` and the object ID `ffff`. The subject key used is taken from `/home/user/intermediate-signing-pub.pem` and the issuer is `/home/user/root-cert.pem`, the resulting certificate is written to `/home/user/intermediate-cert.pem`.
