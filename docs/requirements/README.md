This folder tracks software requirements using UUIDs interspersed with the code.

This is a best-effort mechanism, and while ugly, all other mechanisms for requirements tracability are similarly ugly.

All UUID sets are stored as CSV files in this directory; standard tools such as `grep` should be used to detect all
implementing code.
