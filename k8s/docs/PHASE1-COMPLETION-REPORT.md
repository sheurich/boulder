### 3. Test Servers ⚠️
Test server manifests created but verification needed:
- ⚠️ **Test Servers** - Defined in `/k8s/test/test-servers.yaml`
- ⚠️ **Challenge Test Server** - HTTP-01, DNS-01, TLS-ALPN-01 validation
- ⚠️ **CT Log Test Server** - Certificate Transparency testing
- ⚠️ **Network Configuration** - Multi-network setup for different challenge types
- **Status**: Manifests exist but need deployment testing and verification

### 4. Boulder Monolithic Deployment ✅
- ✅ **Persistent Boulder deployment** using monolith approach
- ✅ **kubectl exec integration** - Tests run inside persistent pod
- ✅ **Boulder monolith manifest** in `/k8s/test/boulder-monolith.yaml`
- ✅ **Service definitions** in `/k8s/test/services.yaml`
- ✅ **Configuration management** via ConfigMaps

### 5. Database Initialization System ✅
- ✅ **Database initialization job** in `/k8s/test/database-init-job.yaml`
- ✅ **Migration support** with sql-migrate integration
- ✅ **User and database creation** automation
- ✅ **ProxySQL configuration** setup
- ✅ **ConfigMap integration** for database configurations

### 6. Network Configuration ⚠️
- ✅ **Network policies** defined in `/k8s/test/network-policies.yaml`
- ✅ **LoadBalancer services** in `/k8s/test/loadbalancer.yaml`
- ⚠️ **Multi-network setup** - Configured but needs validation
- **Status**: Network manifests exist but require testing for proper isolation

## Files Created/Modified

### Main Scripts
1. ✅ `tk8s.sh` - Kubernetes test runner (uses kubectl exec)
2. ✅ `tnk8s.sh` - Config-next variant test runner
3. ✅ `k8s/scripts/k8s-up.sh` - Boulder deployment startup
4. ✅ `k8s/scripts/k8s-down.sh` - Boulder deployment cleanup

### Kubernetes Manifests
1. ✅ `k8s/test/boulder-monolith.yaml` - Boulder persistent deployment
2. ✅ `k8s/test/services.yaml` - Service definitions
3. ✅ `k8s/test/configmaps.yaml` - Configuration management
4. ✅ `k8s/test/database-init-job.yaml` - Database initialization
5. ⚠️ `k8s/test/test-servers.yaml` - Test server deployments (needs verification)
6. ⚠️ `k8s/test/network-policies.yaml` - Network isolation (needs testing)
7. ⚠️ `k8s/test/loadbalancer.yaml` - External access (needs validation)

### Directory Structure
1. ✅ `k8s/manifests/` - Infrastructure service manifests
2. ✅ `k8s/scripts/` - Operational scripts
3. ✅ `k8s/test/` - Test infrastructure and manifests

## Current Implementation Approach

### kubectl exec Pattern
The implementation uses a **persistent Boulder monolith deployment** with tests executed via `kubectl exec`:

```bash
# Example usage
./tk8s.sh --unit  # Runs unit tests inside persistent Boulder pod
./tnk8s.sh --integration  # Config-next integration tests
```

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Persistent Deployment**: Boulder runs as a long-lived deployment, not job-based
2. **kubectl exec**: Tests execute inside the running Boulder container
3. **Service Integration**: All infrastructure services deployed alongside Boulder
4. **Configuration Management**: Uses ConfigMaps for both standard and config-next

## What Has Been Accomplished ✅

### 1. **Core Infrastructure**
- ✅ Directory structure reorganized per specification
- ✅ Service manifests created for all 6 infrastructure components
- ✅ Boulder monolith deployment with persistent approach
- ✅ Database initialization automation

### 2. **Test Runner Implementation**
- ✅ `tk8s.sh` script using kubectl exec pattern
- ✅ `tnk8s.sh` for config-next testing
- ✅ Support for all major test types (unit, integration, lints)
- ✅ Proper cleanup and error handling

### 3. **Kubernetes Integration**
- ✅ Service discovery via Kubernetes DNS + Consul
- ✅ ConfigMap-based configuration management
- ✅ Namespace isolation and resource management
- ✅ Compatible with kind, minikube, and external clusters

### 4. **Operational Scripts**
- ✅ `k8s-up.sh` for Boulder deployment
- ✅ `k8s-down.sh` for cleanup operations
- ✅ Service naming aligned with Docker Compose equivalents

## Current Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Kubernetes cluster (kind, minikube, or external)
2. kubectl configured and connected
3. Boulder Docker images built (`docker compose build boulder`)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests (uses persistent Boulder deployment)
./tk8s.sh --unit

# Run integration tests
./tk8s.sh --integration

# Run with config-next
./tnk8s.sh --unit
./tnk8s.sh --integration

# Deploy Boulder infrastructure
./k8s/scripts/k8s-up.sh

# Clean up deployment
./k8s/scripts/k8s-down.sh
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure services
kubectl apply -k k8s/manifests/

# Deploy Boulder monolith
kubectl apply -f k8s/test/services.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/test/configmaps.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/test/boulder-monolith.yaml

# Initialize databases
kubectl apply -f k8s/test/database-init-job.yaml
```
